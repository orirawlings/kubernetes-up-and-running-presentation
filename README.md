## Description

Kubernetes is a popular, open-source, choice for reliably managing distributed software systems. Kubernetes automates the deployment and scaling of containerized workloads (think Docker) via a declarative and extensible API. This presentation will give an overview and demonstration of Kubernetes to help anyone, who is interested in the system, get up and running.

Ori Rawlings is a Kubernetes user and administrator, who has leveraged the system in production since early 2019. Ori has helped train new Kubernetes users and on-board new and old applications. Ori also has experience extending the Kubernetes API and implementing custom controllers.
